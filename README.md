Abstract: Mosquito-borne Plasmodium knowlesi poses a growing zoonotic threat, primarily in Southeast Asia, where deforestation has intensified human-macaque contact. This study investigates the spillover risk of P. knowlesi from macaques to humans through mosquito vectors, focusing on the impact of deforestation and host population dynamics. Using a stochastic model based on the Gillespie algorithm, we simulated four scenarios with varying human and macaque populations across forested, deforested, and edge areas. Sensitivity analysis using Sobolâ€™s method identified key parameters influencing transmission dynamics. Results reveal that spillover risk is driven by a balance between the dilution effect, where macaques reduce human infection by diverting mosquito bites, and the source effect, where macaques act as reservoirs for infectious mosquitoes. In short simulations, the dilution effect dominated, while in longer simulations, macaques' role as reservoirs became more notable, increasing human infections. The edge effect, with higher mosquito biting rates near forest edges, further complicates transmission dynamics in heterogeneous landscapes. The study highlights the need for more refined modeling approaches that account for spatial heterogeneity and individual host movements. As deforestation continues to alter ecosystems and increase human-wildlife interactions, addressing P. knowlesi transmission risk must be a priority in disease ecology and biodiversity conservation efforts. Future studies should incorporate agent-based models to improve predictive capacity and integrate additional ecological factors such as the presence of non-competent wildlife hosts.
