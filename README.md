Abstract: Zoonotic malaria caused by Plasmodium knowlesi is an emerging threat in Southeast Asia, where rapid deforestation and habitat fragmentation are reshaping human–wildlife–vector interfaces. While deforestation is known to intensify ecological overlap among humans, mosquitoes, and macaque reservoir hosts, the impact of changing host communities and landscape structure on spillover risk remains unclear. Here, deforestation is explicitly modeled as edge accumulation, using the edge ratio—a continuous measure of forest–nonforest boundary—to capture fragmentation across a landscape gradient. A multiplicative risk modeling framework integrates empirical data on mosquito abundance, host densities, biting preferences, and reservoir competence to quantify spillover risk and its drivers. Scenario analyses simulate changes in host populations, while global sensitivity analysis identifies the parameters most critical to risk outcomes. Spillover risk was found to peak at intermediate edge ratios—edge-rich landscapes—where mosquito density and host overlap are maximized, rather than in fully deforested or intact forests. Declines in macaque populations suppress and shift the window of highest risk, while abrupt biodiversity loss produces sharp, threshold-driven surges in risk. Spillover is maximized not where humans are most abundant, but where both competent primate hosts and humans are sufficiently represented in the mosquito biting pool. Sensitivity analysis reveals macaque competence and host diversity as dominant determinants of risk. These findings underscore the importance of targeting surveillance and intervention efforts in edge-rich, transitional landscapes and highlight the need for integrated landscape management that considers spatial configuration and host community dynamics to mitigate zoonotic malaria emergence.
